## Installation


If you want to use Nutanix Node Driver, you need add it in order to start using them to create node templates and eventually node pools for your Kubernetes cluster.

1. From the Home view, choose *Cluster Management* > *Drivers* in the navigation bar. From the Drivers page, select the *Node Drivers* tab.
2. Click *Add Node Driver*.
3. Complete the Add Node Driver form. Then click Create.

    - *Download URL*: `https://github.com/nutanix/docker-machine/releases/download/v3.6.0/docker-machine-driver-nutanix`  
    - *Custom UI URL*: `https://nutanix.github.io/rancher-ui-driver/v3.6.0/component.js`
    - *Checksum*: ``  
    - *Whitelist Domains*: `nutanix.github.io`  
      
    
    *whitelist is mandatory and need to be changed if you relocate the UI driver*

## Project support

Starting `v3.3.0` the Rancher Node driver implements Nutanix Project support. The  prerequisite needed to be able to use the Rancher Node Driver is the following:
- Target cluster and network available in the Project
- Role with the following recommended permission:
  - VM Full Access
  - Cluster View Access
  - Image View Only




## Development

### Build Instructions

build linux/amd64 binary => `make` 
build local binary => `make local`

## History

* v1 is the original Nutanix docker machine driver that connect to Prism Element
* v2.x add Rancher 2.0 support
* v3.x is a rewrite of the driver that connect to Prism Central
