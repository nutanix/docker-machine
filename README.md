Installation
--------------------

If you want to use Nutanix Node Driver, you need add it in order to start using them to create node templates and eventually node pools for your Kubernetes cluster.

1. From the Home view, choose *Cluster Management* > *Drivers* in the navigation bar. From the Drivers page, select the *Node Drivers* tab.
2. Click *Add Node Driver*.
3. Complete the Add Node Driver form. Then click Create.

    - *Download URL*: `https://github.com/nutanix/docker-machine/releases/download/v3.1.0/docker-machine-driver-nutanix_v3.1.0_linux`  
    - *Custom UI URL*: `https://nutanix.github.io/rancher-ui-driver/v3.1.0/component.js`  
    - *Whitelist Domains*: `nutanix.github.io`  
      
    *whitelist is mandatory and need to be changed if you relocate the UI driver*

4. Wait for the driver to become "Active"
5. Go to *RKE1 Configuration > Node Templates*, your can create a Nutanix Template and custom UI should show up.
