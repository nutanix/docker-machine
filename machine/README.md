# Nutanix Docker Machine Driver

This repository contains the docker machine driver for nutanix.

The driver can create VMs in a nutanix managed cluster, and setup docker on it. It uses the MGMT API to achieve this goal.

Build Instructions
--------------------

make sure the vendored (code from the vendor directory) version of docker-machine code is in $GOPATH

`go build -o docker-machine-driver-nutanix main.go` 

Features
---------

1. Ability to select VM's Main Memory in Megabytes
2. Ability to select VM's vCPU count
3. Ability to set a custom name for the newly created VM
4. Ability to set the number of cores per vCPU
5. Ability to specify the network(s) of the VM
6. Ability to specify the template disk in the VM by image name and modify his size (increase only)
7. Ability to specify categories to applied to the VM ( flow, leap, ...)
8. Ability to add one additional disk by specifying disk-size and storage-container
